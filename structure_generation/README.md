# IOMSG-Inorganic Material Structure Generation

## 1.Introduction

The inorganic material structure generation (IMSG) task tackles the inverse-design challenge of creating entirely new crystal structures that satisfy stability and functional constraints without exhaustive enumeration. Models first embed known crystals into symmetry-aware latent spaces—fractional-coordinate graphs, Wyckoff-sequence tokens, or E(3)-equivariant voxel fields. Generators—diffusion models, graph-autoregressive Transformers, or symmetry-equivariant GANs—sample this space. Running on a single GPU, the framework can propose over a thousand candidate crystal structures per minute, dramatically lowering the trial-and-error cost of discovering scintillators, solid-state electrolytes, and high-entropy compounds. Combined with a rapid, tiered screening funnel—machine-learning potential relaxation, energy threshold filtering, and final DFT refinement—this keeps computation affordable and tightly couples theory with experiment.
