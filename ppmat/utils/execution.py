"""Shared execution-backend hooks used by training and prediction.

The trainer and predictor own orchestration, while a model owns the numerical
runtime and its parameters. A model that implements a compiled backend provides::

    set_execution_backend(name)
    validate_execution_backend()

Keeping the protocol here prevents public workflows from depending on a
model-specific adapter and leaves eager models completely unchanged.
