    convert a pymatgen Structure into a PGL graph (pgl.Graph),
    capturing atomic connectivity under periodic boundary conditions.

    Core methods:
      - __init__: Configure neighbor search parameters and parallelism.
      - __call__:  Accepts a single Structure or a list and returns
                   a graph or list of graphs.
      - get_graph_by_crystalnn: Converts one Structure into a PGL graph.
      - build_pgl_graph: Assembles node/edge features into a PGL graph.

    Args:
        cutoff (float):
            Maximum neighbor search distance (in Å). Atom pairs farther
            apart than this are not considered bonded.
        pbc (tuple[int, int, int]):
            Periodic boundary flags along (a, b, c) axes.
            1 enables periodicity, 0 disables it.

            Number of CPU cores to use when processing a list of structures
            in parallel. If None, processes sequentially.
